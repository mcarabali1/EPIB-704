# Course Description

This is a first semester doctoral level course in epidemiologic theory and the estimation of epidemiologic effect measures and their confidence intervals in a variety of different study designs. This course places an emphasis on causal inference concepts and its distinction from, and yet simultaneously dependency, on statistical models. The course will also emphasize the limitations of mainstream null hypothesis statistical significance (NHST) paradigm and encourage the recognition of the value of an estimation (Bayesian) paradigm for optimal inferences.

## Goals

The overarching goal is to establish and strengthen the foundation of epidemiological knowledge, by providing the basis of epidemiology, addressing fundamental and advanced aspects of descriptive epidemiology, causal inference, and data analysis tied to the identification of best practices given the numerous study designs.

## Objective

The objective of EPIB 704 is to provide students with a deeper theoretical understanding of the foundations of epidemiology and empirical tools for data handling, data analysis, critical thinking and interpretation of the epidemiological inference. EPIB 704 will equip student with strategies to 1) identify common threats of the validity or biases, 2) identify and interpret their effects in the measurement of associations, and 3) identify opportunities to investigate, correct and address these biases.

## Instructional Methods

The course will have a "hands-on" approach whereby the various key statistical concepts covered will be illustrated by computer coding, the new calculus for modern epidemiologic methods. Counting has historically been the essential background to epidemiologic research and remains so in the 21st century but is now often best accomplished by simulation and sampling of posterior probability distributions. Examples of the required computing code will be extensively provided.

Attention will also be given to exploratory data analysis (tabular and graphical), data interpretation, critical examination of assumptions and reproducible research. Students will focus mainly on cumulative incidence measures for categorical outcomes, with attention to model checking and screening for confounders and effect measure modifiers. Regression models covered will include linear, logistic, Poisson, survival, and meta-analytical models. Experimental and quasi-experimental designs will be discussed. Other topics that the course will touch on include attributable fractions, selection bias, sensitivity analyses, bootstrapping, matched data, missing data, and misclassified data.

# Lecture Schedule and Slides 

We have pre-selected a list of topics to go through the 13 weeks-long course. Each lecture is aimed at addressing specific epidemiological concepts, addressing both theoretical and analytic/practical aspects. At the beginning of each lecture/topic I will present the learning objectives and expectation. Here you will find a list of the (tentative) Lectures. The recommended readings and links to other resources will be posted on MyCourses by the start of the academic semester.

# Data for Assignments 

Data for assignments can be found in the [/EPIB-704/tree/main/data](https://github.com/mcarabali1/EPIB-704/tree/main/data) folder. 
We have three options for you to import the assignments datasets into R:

- Option 1: Install our epib.704 package:
  - a) First, install the remotes package: `install.packages("remotes")`
  - b) Then, install the epib.704.data package: `remotes::install_github("mcarabali1/epib.704.data")`

- Option 2: Install them directly in R using their URL:
  - a) Assign the df URL to an R object: `urlfile <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcarabali1/EPIB-704/main/data/Plato_FDA_470.csv"`
  - b) Import the df into R: `mydata <- read.csv(url(urlfile))`

- Option 3: Download the files directly from the repository onto your computer and import them into R.
